Used by the routine at <a href="7222.html">7222</a>. This data table consists of eight entries of three bytes each. The exact entry used depends on Sam's and the policeman's locations, and whether Sam's disguise is known to the police. A policeman will be able to spot Sam if the vertical distance between them is no greater than the first byte, the horizontal distance between them is no greater than the second byte, and the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between them is no greater than the third byte.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One of the first two entries is used when Sam is neither visible to passers-by (according to the routine at <a href="70D6.html">70D6</a>) nor standing next to a light switch in the 'on' position, and the policeman is not visible to passers-by.
