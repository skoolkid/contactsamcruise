<div class="box-title">The trouble with hiding</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When Sam is wanted by the police, he is supposed to be able to hide inside
buildings (but not on roofs or in stairwells that are visible from outside) in
order to evade arrest. However, because of a bug in the routine that checks
whether Sam can be spotted by the police in his current location (see <a href="../asm/28886.html">28886</a>),
Sam's attempts at hiding may be either futile or undeservedly successful. In
particular, if Sam is on the roof of or inside a building other than the hotel
(and not in a stairwell that is visible from outside), he will be invisible to
the police if he's facing right, but visible if he's facing left.

<div class="box-title">Hiding in plain sight</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If Sam is wanted by the police, one place he can go and be certain that the
cops will not get him is the far right edge of the roof of the apartment
building next to no. 74. As soon as Sam reaches that spot - at coordinates
(23,6), to be precise - any policemen who are chasing him will turn round and
head for the top floor of the hotel instead.

<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that the region containing the roof of the apartment
building next to no. 74 is defined such that it extends only to x-coordinate 22
instead of 23, and the region adjacent to it (beginning at x-coordinate 23)
corresponds to the top floor of the hotel (see <a href="../asm/61194.html#61416">61416</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In addition, when the cops reach the top floor of the hotel, they will proceed
to the wall of the room on the far right and then freeze.

Another place Sam can go and be certain that the cops will not get him is the
room above his office. First you'll need to get the hook (POKE
<a href="../asm/32745.html">32745</a>,64 while a game is in progress). Then go to the top-floor cyan
room in the apartments next to no. 19, call the police, hang up, go to the
right edge of the roof of the apartments, throw the hook over the roof of
no. 19, make your way across the rope to the roof of no. 17, and go down into
the room above Sam's office. Instead of following Sam there, the police will go
to Sam's office instead and run up and down continuously.

The reason for this is that the routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> assumes that every level of
a building is reachable by climbing staircases going up from the ground
floor. This is true for every building in the city except no. 17: there is no
staircase leading up to the top floor from Sam's office below. So the police
make their way to Sam's office only to find that there is no route up to their
destination.

there is a phone in the far left room on the top floor of the apartment
building from which Sam can call the police.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The key to reproducing this bug is to keep the policemen at bay until both of
them have spotted Sam on the edge of the roof and are heading there to catch
him. This can be done by stepping off the edge of the roof and onto the rope
(which makes a chasing policeman turn round and head the other way), staying
there for a few seconds, and then turning round and stepping off the rope and
back onto the edge of the roof (which makes a chasing policeman turn round
again and head for Sam's location).

<div class="paragraph">
Using this technique, Sam can keep one policeman busy until the other shows up,
and then allow himself to be arrested.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The non-arresting policeman proceeds to the edge of the roof even after Sam has
been arrested because of a quirk in the routine at <a href="../asm/29361.html">29361</a>, which makes the
policeman complete his journey to the spot he was heading for while chasing Sam
before resuming normal patrol duty on the sidewalk.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
But why doesn't the non-arresting policeman then simply step down from the edge
of the roof and return to the sidewalk? Here is where the story gets
complicated.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The policeman is standing at (206,6,1) (on the top-right edge of the roof),
facing right. His destination is somewhere on the sidewalk or road. Under these
conditions, the routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> returns with <span class="register">A</span>=4 (go down) at
<a href="../asm/60812.html#61026">61026</a>. The routine at <a href="../asm/62976.html">62976</a> takes this return value and jumps to the
routine at <a href="../asm/60320.html">60320</a>. This routine then moves the policeman forwards (and
therefore onto the rope), because there is no step going down at (206,6): the
location descriptor for (206,6,1) at <a href="../asm/50165.html">50165</a> says 'left, right' only.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The policeman keeps moving forwards in search of a way down, until he finds one
at the right end of the rope, and takes it. With the policeman now at
(221,7,1), the routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> returns with <span class="register">A</span>=1 (go right) at <a href="../asm/60812.html#61019">61019</a>,
because his x-coordinate (221) is less than the x-coordinate of the top of the
staircase leading down to the floor below (236, as defined by the third byte of
the region identifier entry at <a href="../asm/61194.html#61436">61436</a>; this is the staircase leading down from
the roof of no. 17 to the room above Sam's office). Then the policeman turns
round, heads right, and gets stuck at (222,7,1), because the only available
direction at that location is left (as defined by the location descriptor at
<a href="../asm/47590.html#47598">47598</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note, however, that the policeman who gets stuck in this way can still arrest
Sam (if Sam later becomes wanted by the police, and tries to make his way
across the rope). If that happens, Sam gets stuck too, and the game is
effectively over.

Further evidence that policemen and roofs don't mix can be found on the roof of
the apartment building next to no. 74. If Sam stands in the spot just to the
left of the right edge of this roof when both policemen are chasing him, one
policeman will pick him up, and the other will then pace up and down the roof
continuously, unable to find his way back to the sidewalk and regular patrol
duty.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(There is a phone in the right-hand magenta room on the third floor of the
apartment building from which Sam can call the police.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Again, the key to reproducing this bug is to keep the policemen at bay until
both of them have spotted Sam near the edge of the roof and are heading there
to catch him. This can be done by stepping towards the far right edge of the
roof (which makes a chasing policeman turn round and head the other way),
staying there for a few seconds, and then turning round and stepping back to
the spot just to the left of the edge of the roof (which makes a chasing
policeman turn round again and head for Sam's location).

<div class="paragraph">
So what prevents the non-arresting policeman from returning to the sidewalk
after Sam has been arrested in this case? As noted in the previous bug, there
is a quirk in the routine at <a href="../asm/29361.html">29361</a>, which makes the policeman complete his
journey to the spot he was heading for while chasing Sam before resuming normal
patrol duty on the sidewalk. So first of all, the policeman heads for (22,6),
just to the left of the top-right edge of the roof. Unfortunately, however, he
never makes it there.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Before any character can reach the location at (22,6), he must first pass the
location at (21,7). When the policeman reaches that spot, the routine at
<a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> returns with <span class="register">A</span>=2 (go left) at <a href="../asm/60812.html#61099">61099</a>, because his x-coordinate
(21) is greater than the x-coordinate of the bottom of the (non-existent)
staircase leading to the floor above (20, as defined - incorrectly - by the
fourth byte of the region identifier entry at <a href="../asm/61194.html#61416">61416</a>). Therefore the policeman
turns round and walks left instead of stepping up onto the top edge of the
roof.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Then, when the policeman reaches (19,7), the routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> returns with
<span class="register">A</span>=1 (go right) at <a href="../asm/60812.html#61097">61097</a>, because his x-coordinate (19) is now less than
20. Therefore the policeman turns round and walks right, back to (21,7). And so
on and so forth, until Sam is once again wanted by the police, and the
policeman's destination changes to wherever Sam is.

<div class="box-title">Life sentence</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Sam must have at least $46 when he's arrested, otherwise the game will end
immediately (see <a href="../asm/31642.html">31642</a>). In addition, if Sam has $20 or less when the jailer
comes to let him out of the cell, the routine at <a href="../asm/31594.html">31594</a> will enter an infinite
loop by trying to find a bail amount of $20 or more that Sam can afford,
effectively ending the game and sentencing Sam to a life of suspended animation
in jail.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
But can this actually happen? Is it possible for the jailer to come down from
his office too late to save Sam from a life sentence? Let's do the maths and
see.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
First, let's assume that Sam does have only $46 when he's arrested, and that
he's arrested in the location that is farthest from the police station: the
roof of the apartment building next to no. 74. It takes the arresting policeman
about 1m14s to get to the jail cell (with Sam) from that location. Since Sam
loses a dollar every 5.12s (see <a href="../asm/31414.html">31414</a>), that means he will have no more than
$32 left by the time he's dropped off. And 1m2s later, he will have no more
than $20 - the critical amount. The question thus becomes: is it possible for
the jailer to take more than 1m2s to come down and let Sam out?
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The jailer's routine involves walking up and down in his office for a while,
going down to the cell to let Sam out (if he's there), going back up to the
office, and starting all over again. The number of walkabouts he performs will
be anywhere from 32 to 63 (see <a href="../asm/63304.html">63304</a>). Each walkabout consists of walking to
a randomly chosen spot that is 6, 4, 2 or 0 x-coordinates to the left of the
walkabout origin. Travelling one x-coordinate requires two movements. So the
number of movements the jailer will make while walking up and down in his
office could be as high as 63*12=756, but will be 47.5*5=237.5 on average.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now to translate that into actual time. The character-moving routine at <a href="../asm/61948.html">61948</a>
moves three characters at once, and there are 16 characters to be
moved. Therefore each character is moved on one in every 5.33 passes through
the main loop when running, and one in every 10.66 passes when walking. Passes
through the main loop are made at least 0.02s apart, so a walking character is
moved once every 0.21s. This means that the jailer could spend as much as
756*0.21=158.76s walking up and down in his office, but will on average spend
237.5*0.21=49.875s doing so. To those figures we would need to add the time
taken to walk down to the jail cell from the office.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
So it is possible for the jailer to spend too long in his office before coming
down to let Sam out. Unlikely, but certainly possible.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Post-traumatic teleportation disorder</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When Sam knocks a character over by landing on his head from above, that
character is supposed to:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>(1) drop to the the floor and remain there for a brief period</div>
<div>(2) stand up and stagger around for another brief period</div>
<div>(3) walk back to the spot where he was hit on the head</div>
<div>(4) resume whatever he was doing at the time he was struck</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
But because of a bug in the routine at <a href="../asm/64131.html">64131</a>, the walking back part of step
(3) is omitted. Worse than that, if the character was midstride at the time of
the collision, step (3) is replaced by an immediate teleportation to the
character's pre-knockout, post-midstride coordinates. As a result, you might
see the recovering character zip from A (the point where he stops staggering
around) to B (the spot just to the left or right of where he was hit on the
head) without passing through the intervening space.

<div class="paragraph">
If Sam moves midstride just before being picked up by a policeman, then he can
escape from the jail cell after being dropped there by the simple act of
turning round (to face right). As soon as he does that, he will teleport back
to the spot where he was arrested.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Whenever Sam (or indeed any character) moves midstride, his post-midstride
animatory state, x-coordinate and y-coordinate are calculated and stored in
bytes 5, 6 and 7 of his buffer by the section of code at <a href="../asm/60347.html#60423">60423</a>, to be
retrieved later (usually soon after) by the routine at <a href="../asm/60506.html">60506</a>. However, if Sam
is picked up by a policeman while he's midstride, his post-midstride movement
is delayed. When 'P' is pressed after he's been dropped in the cell, the
routine at <a href="../asm/60636.html">60636</a> is called, which first turns Sam round (because he's facing
left). Then that routine jumps to the code at <a href="../asm/60641.html#60644">60644</a>, which detects the
post-midstride y-coordinate stored in byte 7 of Sam's buffer, and accordingly
sets the midstride timer in byte 9 of his buffer to a non-zero value. A few
passes through the main loop later, the midstride timer is decremented to zero
by the code at <a href="../asm/61483.html#61545">61545</a>, and Sam is belatedly moved to the post-midstride
coordinates that were calculated just before he was arrested.

The reason that the gangsters freeze on the doorstep of no. 19 is a combination
of a quirk in the routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> (which determines the next move a
character should make to reach his destination), the boundary of the inner
region that is watched by the gangsters (as defined at <a href="../asm/64836.html">64836</a>), and the logic
in the routine at <a href="../asm/31362.html">31362</a> (which controls a gangster who is chasing Sam). When
a gangster arrives at the front door his coordinates are (211,31,1) and Sam's
are (212,31,2). The routine at <a href="../asm/60812.html">60812</a> then sends the gangster down a step to
(210,32,2) instead of simply turning him round and changing his z-coordinate
from 1 to 2. But (210,32,2) is outside the inner region watched by the gangster
(which extends only to y-coordinate 31), which means the routine at <a href="../asm/31362.html">31362</a>
will abort without moving the gangster anywhere while Sam remains inside the
inner region.

(Sam can get here without being caught by the gangster either by going via the
roof of no. 27 - assuming he has the key to that house - or by calling the
police and enduring a brief stint in jail first.)  When the gangster is beyond
the left edge of the police station steps, step down onto the sidewalk, and
then quickly back up onto the police station steps. The gangster will follow
Sam onto the first step above the sidewalk and then freeze:

The gangster will remain frozen until Sam leaves the outer region
(0&lt;=x&lt;255, 10&lt;=y&lt;36) by going to y=9 (between the 4th and 5th
floors of a building). It's possible for Sam to run past the gangster (towards
no. 31 on the left) while he's frozen without being picked up, but this
manoeuvre requires perfect timing that's impossible to judge from just watching
the screen, and will fail more often than not.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">An urgent message delayed</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/30160.html">30160</a> is supposed to determine the amount of time for which
the current message (or message portion) should remain on screen before the
next one is displayed. This interval is normally 2.56s, but is reduced to 0.64s
if an urgent message has been queued (see <a href="../asm/30154.html">30154</a>). However, if the urgent
message number is stored at a lower address in the 8-byte message queue at
<a href="../asm/32696.html">32696</a> than the number of the message currently being displayed, the routine
at <a href="../asm/30160.html">30160</a> will fail to find it, and so messages will continue to be displayed
at normal speed. To demonstrate this:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>1. When a new game starts, the message index (held in bits 0-2 at <a href="../asm/32695.html">32695</a>)
is 3; increase it to 7 by picking up a phone and hanging up twice.</div>
<div>2. Pick up a phone other than Sam's, dial 7337, and wait for Daisy to
start relaying the message to Sam; now the message index is 7 (again).</div>
<div>3. While Daisy is relaying the message to Sam, quickly hang up and then
press 'J'; this queues an urgent message (see <a href="../asm/24951.html">24951</a>) with index 0, which is
less than the index of the message currently being displayed (7).</div>
<div>4. Note how the game pauses, but the message from Daisy continues to
display at normal speed, until finally 'JOYSTICK?' appears.</div>

be transparent:

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that the routine at <a href="../asm/63784.html">63784</a>, which prepares the tiles
for a knocked-out sprite by making rotated copies of tiles 1-4 and 6-9
of the character's base sprite, needlessly makes rotated copies of blank tiles
(those with a tile reference of 0) too. However, the blank tile (the graphic
and mask data for which are located at addresses 50944 TO 54784 STEP 256)
does not contain the correct mask data - it is all zeroes instead of 255s.
This is not normally a problem because the sprite-tile-printing routine at
<a href="../asm/59635.html">59635</a> is optimised to ignore sprite tiles with a tile reference of 0. But
the rotated copies of the blank tile have non-zero tile references, and are
therefore drawn.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This bug is noticeable if Sam knocks over one of the affected characters on the
sidewalk: the blank tiles will obscure parts of the building (and possibly
other characters) behind the stunned character, as shown here where Sam has
just landed on Daisy after being dropped from the roof of no. 19:

When Sam moves up from the sidewalk onto the front steps of a building, his

<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that the location descriptors for z=4 (see <a href="../asm/50176.html">50176</a>) that
correspond to the front steps of buildings don't have bit 0 or bit 1 set to
indicate that a z-coordinate transition should occur, and so the section of
code at <a href="../asm/60347.html#60404">60404</a> leaves Sam's z-coordinate unchanged upon climbing the step.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Conversely, the location descriptors for z=4 that correspond to the places
where there is a step up from the road to the sidewalk (at x=7, 14, 164 and
198) do have bit 0 or bit 1 set. So when Sam moves up from the road to the
sidewalk, his z-coordinate will change from 4 to 2, which means that other

front of him.

The reason this happens is that the routine at <a href="../asm/25420.html">25420</a> brings the banknote out
