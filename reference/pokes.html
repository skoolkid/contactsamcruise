<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Infinite money</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To prevent Sam's supply of money from running out:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/6E87.html#6e95">28310</a>,254
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="easyMoney"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Easy money</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If the infinite money POKE feels like too much of a cheat, try one or more of
these sets of POKEs, which make it a bit easier for Sam to augment his cash
supply with the proceeds of the recent bank robbery:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
POKE <a href="../asm/6333.html#6338">25401</a>,0: POKE 25404,0: POKE 25406,0: POKE 25409,0 (prevents a
banknote from fluttering up and down once it has hit the ground)
</div>
<div>
POKE <a href="../asm/634C.html#63b6">25526</a>,0 (prevents a banknote from moving down the street)
</div>
<div>
POKE <a href="../asm/61CF.html#61d2">25043</a>,100: POKE 25046,24 (makes every banknote worth $100)
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="infiniteFirstAid"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Infinite first aid</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To prevent Sam's first aid kits from running out:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/6592.html#65c6">26054</a>,0
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="cheapTalk"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Cheap talk</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To make outgoing phone calls cost nothing instead of the usual exorbitant $2:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/76FA.html#7718">30491</a>,173
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="getOutOfJail"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Get out of jail</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To enable Sam to leave the jail cell at any time (even after being arrested):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/7B5C.html#7b5f">31583</a>,195
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note, however, that if Sam leaves the jail cell and the vicinity of the police
station after being arrested and before being officially released, and then
later returns to the vicinity of the police station with $20 or less on his
person, the game will freeze when the jailer next enters the cell (see
<a href="../asm/7B6A.html">7B6A</a>).
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="getOutOfJailFree"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Get out of jail free</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If you're happy for Sam to serve time in jail, but would prefer him to be
released without having to pay bail:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/7B6A.html#7b75">31605</a>,201
</div>

<div><span id="everybodyOut"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Everybody out</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When characters (including Sam) are indoors, it's difficult to see where they
are as they move up or down staircases and between windows. To make it so that
characters are always drawn in front of buildings, even when they are inside:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/E8F3.html#e8fe">59646</a>,125
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="perfectDisguises"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Perfect disguises</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Sam's disguises can be useful for evading the law now and then, but the police
soon catch on to them; to make the disguises effective for ever:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/71AC.html#71d9">29145</a>,0
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="privateRooms"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Private rooms</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The rooms on the ground floor of the hotel are not accessible: neither Sam nor
any other character can enter them. In fact, they are the only rooms in the
entire play area that are off limits.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To make the room on the left accessible to Sam:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/BC6E.html">48239</a>,204</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/BC6E.html">48240</a>,192</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/C500.html#c53e">50494</a>,47</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/C600.html#c63e">50750</a>,195</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Next, the room on the right:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/BA7A.html">47739</a>,204</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/BA7A.html">47740</a>,192</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
And finally, to add light switches and usable window blinds to each room:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/F500.html#f587">62855</a>,68</div>
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/F500.html#f587">62860</a>,132</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now Sam can enter either one of these rooms by first going to the hotel
entrance and then walking left or right until he passes through the wall.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div><span id="stairwayToTheSafe"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Stairway to the safe</div>
<div class="paragraph">
For some reason, the builders forgot to add a staircase leading from the third
floor of no. 17 (where Sam's office is) to the top floor (where the safe
containing the budgie is). To correct this omission:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</div>
<div><span id="noSnipers"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">No snipers</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To prevent snipers from showing up in the game:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/62DB.html">25307</a>,201
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="mobstopper"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Mobstopper</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In game modes 1-3, there are various gangsters who will chase Sam with the
intent of throwing him off the roof of a building if he gets too close to
them. To make these gangsters completely unaware of Sam's presence:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/7A57.html#7a5d">31325</a>,195
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In game mode 4, after Lana has been put in jail, Sam is chased relentlessly by
one of the mob, who will keep dumping him off the roof of the apartment
building next to no. 19 until he runs out of money. To disable this gangster
and enable Sam to walk freely around the city with the budgie:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/FD6E.html">64878</a>,49
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="allKeys"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">All keys</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To give Sam the keys to no. 15, no. 27, no. 31 and no. 74 while a game is in
progress:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/7FEA.html">32746</a>,120
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To give Sam the key to no. 19 as well:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/7FEA.html">32746</a>,248
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note, however, that Sam will not be able to get the budgie while he has the key
to no. 19; this is because the event table entry at <a href="../asm/5FE0.html#6097">6097</a> checks whether Sam
has the keys to no. 15, no. 27, no. 31 and no. 74 only before making the budgie
available.

<div><span id="keepTheLightsOn"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Keep the lights on</div>
<div class="paragraph">
People have an annoying tendency to flip light switches off as they walk past
them, which can make it tricky to navigate inside a building. To ensure that
the lights stay on (even when a fuse is blown):
