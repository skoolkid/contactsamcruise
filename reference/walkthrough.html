<p>The walkthrough that follows is not the only way to complete the game, nor
is it necessarily the quickest; however, it is an attempt to list the game's
important events in a logical order, and includes every cash bonus and phone
message that it's possible to receive.</p>

A DAMED NAMED LANA. SHE SAID TO MEET HER ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE HOTEL ROYALE.
